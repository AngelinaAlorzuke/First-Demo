                     Sometimes i feel like i already know what am about to learn, 
                     or when am learning, my mind tells me i can do it. But when it comes to practical,
                    i found it more diffcult than it seems to look. 
                    Now that i have realized my weakness, i will try my best to do practicals more than theory.
